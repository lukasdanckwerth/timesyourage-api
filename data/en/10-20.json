She initially gained recognition for her appearances on the television talent show Young Talent Time (1982–1988) and for her role as Emma Jackson on the soap opera Home and Away (1989–1990). Minogue began her music career in the early 1990s, achieving early success with her debut studio album, Love and Kisses (1991), which included the hit singles \"Love and Kisses\", \"Baby Love\", \"Jump to the Beat\" and \"Success\". Following the release of her second studio album, Get into You (1993), Minogue's popularity as a singer had declined, only producing one successful single \"This Is It\". This led her to make a name for herself with television presenting and award-winning performances in theatre productions.",

His music was largely ignored during his early life, and many of his works went unperformed for many years.

He was also among the first composers to engage in a systematic program of experimental music, with musical techniques including polytonality, polyrhythm, tone clusters, aleatory elements, and quarter tones. His experimentation foreshadowed many musical innovations that were later more widely adopted during the 20th century. Hence, he is often regarded as the leading American composer of art music of the 20th century.",

He published the basic concept of natural selection as a mechanism in evolutionary adaptation and speciation in 1831, but did not further develop or publicize his ideas. Consequently, when Charles Darwin later published On the Origin of Species in 1859, he and Alfred Russel Wallace were regarded by their scientific peers as having originated the theory of evolution by natural selection; it has been suggested that Darwin and/or Wallace had encountered Matthew's earlier work, but there is no hard evidence of this. After the publication of On the Origin of Species, Matthew contacted Darwin, who in subsequent editions of the book acknowledged that the principle of natural selection had been anticipated by Matthew's brief statement, mostly contained in the appendices and addendum of his 1831 book On Naval Timber and Arboriculture.",
