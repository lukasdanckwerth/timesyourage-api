By befriending, not objectifying her subjects, she was able to capture in her work a rare psychological intensity.\" In his 2003 New York Times Magazine article, \"Arbus Reconsidered,\" Arthur Lubow states, \"She was fascinated by people who were visibly creating their own identities—cross-dressers, nudists, sideshow performers, tattooed men, the nouveaux riches, the movie-star fans—and by those who were trapped in a uniform that no longer provided any security or comfort.\" Michael Kimmelman writes in his review of the exhibition Diane Arbus Revelations, that her work \"transformed the art of photography \".",
