Much of his philosophical work deals with the issues of how one lives as a \"single individual\", giving priority to concrete human reality over abstract thinking and highlighting the importance of personal choice and commitment. He was against literary critics who defined idealist intellectuals and philosophers of his time, and thought that Swedenborg, Hegel, Fichte, Schelling, Schlegel, and Hans Christian Andersen were all \"understood\" far too quickly by \"scholars\".",
