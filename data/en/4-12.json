    "extract": "Muhammad ibn Ali al-Jawad was a descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the ninth of the Twelve Imams, succeeding his father, Ali al-Rida. He was known as al-Jawad and al-Taqi. Similar to many of his predecessors, al-Jawad kept aloof from politics and engaged in teaching. He was also renowned for his public defense of Islamic tradition. Al-Jawad organized the affairs of the Shia through a large network of representatives. His extensive correspondence with his followers on questions of Islamic law has been preserved in Shia sources. Numerous pithy religio-ethical sayings are also attributed to him.",
