Jardine was known for upset victories in bouts he took at short notice against highly rated fighters. His best wins were in contests with former UFC Light Heavyweight Champions and UFC Hall of Famers Chuck Liddell and Forrest Griffin. Jardine's unorthodox attacking style wrongfooted opponents, but left him vulnerable in some career-crucial contests, and by his mid-30s he had effectively retired from competing to concentrate on a 'Paleo' business venture. Building on experience as a stuntman and in non-speaking parts, Jardine has established himself as an actor in film and television and goes by the nickname of “the Dean of Mean.”",

By the end of the century he was placed in the canon of English literature, strongly influencing many writers of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood ; the Encyclopædia Britannica of 1888 called one ode \"one of the final masterpieces\". Jorge Luis Borges named his first encounter with Keats an experience he felt all his life. Keats had a style \"heavily loaded with sensualities\", notably in the series of odes. Typically of the Romantics, he accentuated extreme emotion through natural imagery. Today his poems and letters remain among the most popular and analysed in English literature – in particular \"Ode to a Nightingale\", \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Sleep and Poetry\" and the sonnet \"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer\".",
