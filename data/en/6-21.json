    "extract": "Alois Hába was a Czech composer, music theorist and teacher. He belongs to the important discoverers in modern classical music, and major composers of microtonal music, especially using the quarter-tone scale, though he used others such as sixth-tones, fifth-tones, and twelfth-tones. From the other mictrotonal conceptions, he discussed a \"three-quarter tone\" system in his theoretical works but he used scales in this tuning in sections of some of his compositions. In his prolific career, Hába composed three operas, an enormous collection of chamber music including 16 string quartets, piano, organ and choral pieces, some orchestral works and songs. He also had special keyboard and woodwind instruments constructed that were capable of playing quarter-tone scales.",

Andrew Bacevich labelled Niebuhr's book The Irony of American History \"the most important book ever written on U.S. foreign policy.\" The historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. described Niebuhr as \"the most influential American theologian of the 20th century\" and Time posthumously called Niebuhr \"the greatest Protestant theologian in America since Jonathan Edwards.\"",
