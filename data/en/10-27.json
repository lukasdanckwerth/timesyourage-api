His signature playing style was a cornerstone of the pop-oriented \"Nashville sound\" of the 1950s and 1960s. Cramer's \"slip-note\" or \"bent-note\" style, in which a passing note slides almost instantly into or away from a chordal note, influenced a generation of pianists. His sound became popular to the degree that he stepped out of his role as a sideman and began touring as a solo act. In 1960, his piano instrumental solo, \"Last Date\" went to number two on the Billboard Hot 100 pop music chart and sold over one million copies. Its follow-up, \"On the Rebound\", topped the UK Singles Chart in 1961. As a studio musician, he became one of a cadre of elite players dubbed the Nashville A-Team and he performed on scores of hit records.",
