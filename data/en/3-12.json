Berkeley is also known for his critique of abstraction, an important premise in his argument for immaterialism.",

    "extract": "John Aubrey was an English antiquary, natural philosopher and writer. He is perhaps best known as the author of the Brief Lives, his collection of short biographical pieces. He was a pioneer archaeologist, who recorded numerous megalithic and other field monuments in southern England, and who is particularly noted for his systematic examination of the Avebury henge monument. The Aubrey holes at Stonehenge are named after him, although there is considerable doubt as to whether the holes that he observed are those that currently bear the name. He was also a pioneer folklorist, collecting together a miscellany of material on customs, traditions and beliefs under the title \"Remaines of Gentilisme and Judaisme\". He set out to compile county histories of both Wiltshire and Surrey, although both projects remained unfinished. His \"Interpretation of Villare Anglicanum\" was the first attempt to compile a full-length study of English place-names. He had wider interests in applied mathematics and astronomy, and was friendly with many of the greatest scientists of the day.",
